### Added
- This CHANGELOG file.
- Handling cases when the firewall zones are assigned to both the network
  interface and the bridge of which the interface is a member. In this case,
  information about both firewall zones is displayed.
- Added vertical table view mode. By default used new vertical mode. This may
  changed by the `global.default_h_mode` option in `/etc/config/luci_netports`
  configuration file. If used horizontal mode then view mode is automatically
  switched to vertical mode in case the number of interfaces is more than 6.

  is disabled (not shown). Button may be enabled by the `global.hv_mode_switch_button`
  option in `/etc/config/luci_netports` configuration file.

- Added `usb_stick`, `usb_2g`, `usb_3g`, `usb_4g`, `tunnel`, `gprs`, `ppp`
  and `usb_wifi` new types and icons.

- Icons moved to `icons` subdirectory.

- Renamed "Network interface" parameter to "Interface" in the table.
